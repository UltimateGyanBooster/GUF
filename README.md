GitHub User Finder
In 'GUF', we can search GitHub users by their GitHub username and we will 
get user's profile information along with links to latest 5 repositories as you 
type in the search query.
ï‚· Every time you type something (every word), the application will make a 
request to GitHub API looking for the typed username [Use of keyup event] 
and respective user information matching the query will be displayed. If user 
not found, an alert message will be displayed which will disappear after 
3000 seconds
